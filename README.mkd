# README

These tutorials are "loose" haskell ports of those available at http://www.opengl-tutorial.org

"Loose", because :

- They use OpenGL 3.1, instead of the original 3.3 (the laptop I'm using only has an Intel HD3000 chipset).
- When Haskell allows me to take shortcuts (i.e. reduce the verbosity), then I do take them.
